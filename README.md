**A500-EXT-CFIDE** is an external IDE + Fast Memory Expansion for Amiga 500. 

It is basically a modified clone of Matthias Heinrich's CDTV-RAM-IDE board, targeted to be a quick & dirt solution for external A500/A1000 bootable mass storage (with the bonus of a RAM expansion if fitted).

The firmware is a customized version of original Matthias code, and comes thank to the wonderful kindness of Matthias himself, who put the effort and coded this derivative one as well. Thanks Matthias ! 

Within repository full schematics, board, gerbers and firmware code can be found free for everyone.
Please note that rev.1.0 board (the current one) has not been optimized against design rules, so though the project has been tested and proved fully working, a further rev.1.1 board will be released in next future, addressing all desgin "misbehaviours".
