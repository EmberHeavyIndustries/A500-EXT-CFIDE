**AMI*RGB2VGA** is a functional replacement / alternative to the 390682-01/03 VGA dongle which came with A4000.
This adaptor is also knows as "synch dongle" because it does not process rgb analog signals in any way, passing them unchanged fron the Amiga db23 video port to the vga monitor input.

A zillion of similar solutions exist, being the circuit trivially simple; what it makes AMI*RGB2VGA different from others is the capability of hosting up to four different buffer chips, each one of them behaving in a subtle different manner towards the final video render ap√®pearance on modern lcd monitors.

Users can populate the board with any of the chips, activate the one which offers the best video quality according their personal taste, and change it at any time with great ease.
